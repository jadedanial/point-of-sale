# General Information
An inventory system for small to mid-size businesses to handle sales, purchasing, and inventory management and control. It can help track available stocks, add and purchase from vendors, add and take customers' orders, reorder stocks, add products, and generate reports.

DanialSoft POS help small to mid-size businesses easily and efficiently manage the ordering, stocking, storing, and using of inventory. By effectively managing inventory, you’ll always know what items are in stock, how many of them there are, and where they are located.



# Technology Used

This project was built using Python 3.10.4 and Django 4.0.3 and uses the following technologies:

- PyQt5==5.15.6 - For building the GUI.
- psycopg2==2.9.3 - PostgreSQL adapter for Python.
- pandas==1.4.2 - For generating reports.
- pdfkit==1.0.0 - Converting reports to PDF.



# Features

## Tracking

The primary role of DanialSoft POS is to track your products and supplies. It keeps records of when you purchased inventory, when you sold it and how much you have on hand. It also tells you the location of your inventory.

## Preventing Out-of-stock

It can alert you when you are running low on an item. This allows you to order it in a timely manner so you don’t have to turn customers away if you run out. In addition, you won’t have to order as much back stock to keep on your shelves because you can count on your inventory control system to alert you when levels drop to a critical point.

## Price Control

DanialSoft POS can tell you the various prices you pay for inventory throughout the year. Even if you bought the same item several times at different prices, it can track those prices so you know your average price. This can help you set selling prices and calculate your profit margin.

## Counting

You do not have to pay employees to physically count items. You will know how much you have at all times based on the data in your system. This can save a great deal of money on payroll for inventory personnel.
